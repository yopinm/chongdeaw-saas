## Current Status
Ready to start in safe mode

## Completed Tasks
- None

## Current Task Status
- None

## In Progress
- None

## Blockers
- None confirmed

## Next Task
TASK-001

## Last Safe Baseline
Confirmed baseline commit exists before safe mode run.
If more manual edits are made before running Claude again, create a new safety commit first.

## Safe Mode Working Rules
- Execute only one task at a time
- Update this file after every task
- Record task result as DONE, PARTIAL, or BLOCKED
- Record changed files
- Record light validation performed
- Record commit message used
- If token/context risk increases, stop before starting the next task

## Resume Rule
When resuming, Claude must:
1. read this file first
2. verify current task status
3. trust committed state over memory
4. continue only from `Next Task`

## Safe Stop Template
When stopping, append a short note with:
- Task: TASK-XXX
- Status: DONE / PARTIAL / BLOCKED
- Changed Files:
- Validation:
- Commit:
- Next Safe Step:
